**Monotonic Depth Perception**
- Shape from Shading (assumes uniform albedo, reflectange and known light source)
- Shape from  Texture (assumes presence of pattern, and regularity / repetition of that pattern)
- Shape from Focus (from two images from same position but different Depth of Fields)
- Shape from  more noisy due to assumptions

*Photometric Stereo*: 
- have known (position, angle, colour) lights schining from different angles turned on and off
