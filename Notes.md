#Notes

##PAT Meetings
###Week 1
- Write mail to ask for buying the device. 3 different qualities: pro, amateur, low.
- To read papers: start with *abstract* then *conclusion* to get an idea about the topic. If subject corresponds, look at references of this paper. 
- Use google scholar / a-z.lu and search last 5 years about stereoscopic view papers to see learn state of the art algorithms


##PTA Meetings
###Week 1
- Writing *PSD* is current most important part

##Self 
###Stereo correspondance
- Points left of other point will stay left except high depth difference
- all the points on one horizontal line will stay on that horizontal line
- Goal: Minimize the *sum* of errors over the row

##Papers
- **Stereo matching with adaptive window**
*Main Idea*: See the variance of the color around one pixel and if the variance is low take a higher window for higher accuracy.
